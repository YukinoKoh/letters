One Sunday morning earlier this year, I was catching up with my friend over coffee after breakfast at her house. It was about to stop raining outside. The grey mountain which had been covered with the low clouds started to show its ridge under slight sunlight. The small path wet with rainwater also started to reflect the light.

Knowing that the current flight restrictions ask us to stay at one place, we wondered about a life style to move across countries several times a year. Turning the pages of the books that had arrived from different places, we talked about 'detachment' that we fundamentally may not possess anything, but live to return those came across our life to the world.




....

I'm still testing how this template works and tweaking it to the style I'd like to talk to you.
